        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>As an enthusiastic and adaptable computer engineering student, I'm embarked on an exciting journey to explore the ever-evolving realm of technology. My passion for problem-solving and software development spans across websites, mobile apps, and game development, driving my quest for practical experience and in-depth knowledge in this dynamic field. My academic pursuits naturally lead me to focus on computer engineering, where I'm committed to refining my skills and expanding my understanding. However, I'm not content with merely absorbing knowledge; I'm determined to apply it to create meaningful impact. The prospect of quantum computing, with its potential to address complex challenges, captivates me as the next frontier of innovation. As I immerse myself in the tech industry, I eagerly seek opportunities to gain hands-on experience, establish valuable connections, and contribute to real-world projects where I can showcase my problem-solving prowess. Collaboration, mentorship, and opportunities aligned with my passion for pushing technological boundaries are what I actively pursue.</p>
